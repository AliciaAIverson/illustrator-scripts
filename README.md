Kelso's Cartography and Graphic Design Scripts for Adobe Illustrator
=============

I used to work for the Washington Post newspaper as a cartographer creating maps for daily publication. The two popular desktop graphics applications for mapping are Macromedia Freehand and Adode Illustrator. With Adobe's purchase of the former circa 2008 (primarily for Macromedia's Flash interactive content platform, what a wild ride that was) Freehand was end-of-life'd in favor of Illustrator. I've hacked together some scripts to ease the transition. I also include a few other useful scripts and plugins for cartographers and graphics designers in the "other-authors" directory.

A pretty version of documenting these scripts:

Installation
-------

     1. Quit Illustrator
     2. Copy the files into the Illustrator application folder's "Presets" È "Scripts" subfolder
     3. After restarting Illustrator you can find the scripts in the menu "File" È "Scripts";

TIP: You can create subfolders in the scripts folder to organize your scripts (like they are organized here)
