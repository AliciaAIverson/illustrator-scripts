The following scripts were removed at the request of James E. Talmage (JET). Please inquire about them directly to Mr. Talmage: JET@illustrationetc.com. Good luck, you'll need it!

I had included his scripts here, with full attribution, to preserve our collective coding heritage after his site went offline. They among the best examples of Adobe Illustrator scripts out there. However, he has very strong feelings about this.
